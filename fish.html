    <p align="center">As a Scottish-based artist, I am continuously inspired by the rugged and 
      untamed beauty of the landscape in which I reside. My chosen mediums of fabric arts and 
      knife throwing may seem like an unlikely pairing, but for me, they represent a powerful 
      synergy between the delicate and the dangerous. I seek to align the polarities of chaos 
      and order, movement and stillness, in my work. Through the act of throwing knives at 
      intricately-crafted fabric pieces, I am able to tap into a retrograde state of mind, 
      where intuition and precision merge harmoniously. My creations reflect the raw and 
      primal essence of the Scottish Highlands, while also imbuing a sense of whimsy and danger.
